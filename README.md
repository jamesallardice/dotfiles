# dotfiles

My personal OS X configuration. Just run `./bin/setup`.

## Notes for others

If you are forking or attempting to use these dotfiles yourself (and your name
is not James Allardice) you'll need to make a couple of changes:

- In `copy/home/.gitconfig` replace the name and email address with your own.
- In `bin/macos` replace the computer name with one that makes sense for you.
